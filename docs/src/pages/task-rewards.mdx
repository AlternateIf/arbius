# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Semper API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Semper API, you will need to grab your
  API key from the dashboard. You find it under [siwe](/siwe).
</Note>

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Semper allows you to use the OpenAI clients for JavaScript and Python. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
curl --version
```

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
# Install the OpenAI JavaScript SDK
npm install openai
```

```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
# Install the OpenAI Python SDK
pip install openai
```

</CodeGroup>

    variant="text"

    children="Check out our list of SDKs"
  />
</div>

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Semper API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Completions endpoint to generate text. In the cURL example, results are limited to seven tokens.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/completions">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl https://api.semper.ai/v1/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
  -d '{
    "model": "text-davinci-001",
    "prompt": "Say this is a test",
    "max_tokens": 7,
    "temperature": 0
  }'
```

```js
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  basePath: 'https://api.semper.ai/v1',
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
const response = await openai.createCompletion({
  model: "text-davinci-001",
  prompt: "Say this is a test",
  max_tokens: 7,
  temperature: 0,
});
```

```python
import os
import openai
openai.api_base = 'https://api.semper.ai/v1'
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai.Completion.create(
  model="text-davinci-001",
  prompt="Say this is a test",
  max_tokens=7,
  temperature=0
)
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/completions"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read the docs for the Completions endpoint"
  />
</div>

## What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the Semper API:
