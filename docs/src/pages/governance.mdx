# Governance

<Note> Governance will be enabled when there is sufficient token distribution.</Note>


The Arbius token is used for governance, conferring voting rights over future protocol upgrades and control of the Arbius treasury.

Governance is done on-chain, we utilize IPFS to store the description text reducing our reliance on centralized indexers.

All of the following parameters may be updated using future governance proposals. The launch parameters are intended to be conservative.

## Delegation

Users can delegate their voting rights to another address on the governance page. You can also of course delegate to yourself to participate in voting.

## Voting Delay

Users have `3` days to prepare their Arbius for voting once a proposal has been submitted. No voting may take place during this period.

## Voting Period

Users have `3` days to vote on a proposal. We use Bravo style voting which allows for "For", "Against", and "Abstain" choices.

## Proposal Threshold

We require a minimum of `1000` Arbius (or 0.1% of complete total supply) for creating a proposal.

## Quorum

Arbius requires a 4% quorum of "For" votes to pass a proposal.

## Timelock Queue

Once a proposal passes, there is a `1` day period where people may pull their funds from Arbius if they are unhappy with the results of the vote.

## Proposing

If you have at least the minimum threshold of tokens delegated to you, you may propose new actions.

You will want to edit the `governance:propose` task in `/arbius/contract/task/index.ts` and create a markdown file that describes your proposal.

Then, once everything is ready run:

```bash
npx hardhat --network nova governance:propose -f DESCRIPTION.md
```

This task will show you your proposal id. Miners will automatically mirror the proposal description on their IPFS servers. 

## Final thoughts

Governance is best done in the open. Please communicate any proposals and gain community support before proposing any transaction.
