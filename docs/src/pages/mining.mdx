# Mining Kandinsky-2 on Arbius

This guide will walk you through the process of mining Kandinsky-2 on the Arbius network. Kadinsky-2 is the model Arbius is launching with as the model to bootstrap miners to the network and reward them. For this model, it is configured to run on Nvidia A100 GPU. In the future, we plan to support other chipsets, for now you will need to have access to a A100 GPU to mine Arbius.

<Note>The Arbius mining software only supports a single GPU at this time.</Note>

## Get A100 GPU

We recommend Lambda Labs cloud hosting for this model, this been tested to function properly. There are many service providers of A100 chips via GPU clouds and other places, in the likely case that you don't have a A100 chip yourself.

<Note>Some providers have a configuration which introduces differences in compute, this will be detected on boot of miner with a hash check and will cause miner to not be able to validate tasks. If you are locally hosting your A100, you will need to ensure it is set up properly.</Note>

The recommended storage space required for the computer running the A100 chip is 60GB. The miner and the A100 GPU instance does not need to be the same computer, the actual miner software just needs the URL for the instance running the COG.

## What is a Cog file?

[Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) is an open-source tool that packages machine learning models in a standard, production-ready container. In Arbius we deploy cogs via docker, and the miner connects to the docker instance for model input and output. 

Therefore to mine Arbius, we have to deploy a docker image of a registered model.


## Docker

You will need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) installed on the computer with the A100 chip. Some GPU cloud services offer dockerized containers, so you will not need to install docker yourself, but will need to run the miner on your own computer or separate VPS.

If running your own computer with the A100 chip, after installing docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --gpus=all r8.im/kasumi-1/kandinsky-2@sha256:373fa540ae197fc89f0679ed835bc4524152956d4f3027580244e10b09d6d3a5
```

The URL above is the Kadinsky-2 model required to mine Arbius. There is only one model for now.

<summary>Other providers</summary>

Community members have also managed to run the model on other cloud gpus such as [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io/) and [Vast](https://vast.ai/).

### RunPod
You need to create a new GPU Pod with the Docker image.
1. Create a new A100 GPU Pod and click deploy.
2. Customize Deployment
  i. Set the Docker Image to `r8.im/kasumi-1/kandinsky-2@sha256:373fa540ae197fc89f0679ed835bc4524152956d4f3027580244e10b09d6d3a5`
  ii. Set the Storage to `60GB`
  iii. Expose HTTP port `5000` if you wish to run the miner script on a different server.
  iv. Set Overrides
3. Click Continue and then Deploy.
4. Go to pods page and wait for the pod to be ready and for the model to be downloaded then connect to the server either using the web terminal or ssh using the provided credentials.
5. Setup mining software using the instructions found below.

### Vast

<Note>At the time of writing, the Vast GUI is broken and doesn't allow pasting the Docker image correctly and so you must use the GUI.</Note>

1. Download Vast CLI from [here](https://cloud.vast.ai/cli/)
2. Find a suitable instance using the GUI or the website and note it's id (found in the bottom left as `Type #<id>`).
3. Run the following command after installing the Vast CLI, replacing `<instance-id>` with the number noted down earlier:

<Note>Dependig on how you installed the Vast CLI you may need to replace `/.vast` with `vastai`.</Note>

> ```bash
> ./vast create instance <instance-id> --image r8.im/kasumi-1/kandinsky-2@sha256:373fa540ae197fc89f0679ed835bc4524152956d4f3027580244e10b09d6d3a5 --env '-p 5000:5000 -p 22:22' --onstart-cmd 'python -m cog.server.http' --jupyter-dir /src --ssh --direct --disk 100
> ```

5. Setup mining software using the instructions found below.

## Setup Mining Software and Dependencies

You may run the mining software on a local machine or on a cloud instance. Especially if using a cloud instance, ensure that you properly secure the machine.

### Install NVM

NVM is a version manager for Node.js, which is required to run the mining software.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

### Install IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

IPFS is a distributed file system that will be used to share generated content.

Follow this guide to ensure you have IPFS installed:

https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/

Make sure you are running IPFS as a daemon:

```bash
ipfs init
ipfs daemon
```

You will need to keep IPFS on whilst the miner is running.

<Note>As an alternative, you can use pinata if you do not want to host your own IPFS node.</Note>


### Install Arbius Reference Miner

The Arbius reference miner is a simple mining software that will be used to mine Kandinsky-2 on the Arbius network. It is designed to be easy to use and debug. We recommend reading the code to understand how it works, and to contribute improvements upstream.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/semperai/arbius.git
cd arbius/miner
nvm use
# if you don't have yarn installed already
npm install -g yarn
yarn # install dependencies
```

### Setup RPC Endpoint

You will need to provide an RPC endpoint for the Arbius network. You can run your own node, or use a public node. We recommend running your own node for security and performance reasons, however it is not necessary. For testing setup, you can use a public node.

https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers

Note: you will need to run your node on Arbitrum Nova network.


### Generate Wallet for Miner

Arbius has a built in wallet generator, you can also use MetaMask or other tools to generate a new private key. We strongly recommend using a new private key for each miner.

```bash
cd arbius/contract
cp .env.example .env
nvm use
yarn
npx hardhat gen-wallet
```

### Configure Mining Software

Within the `arbius/miner` directory, copy the example configuration file to a new file called `MiningConfig.json`.

```bash
cp  MiningConfig.example.json MiningConfig.json
```

#### Blockchain Configuration

Edit `MiningConfig.json` to include your miners private key and the RPC endpoint.

```json
{
  "blockchain": {
    "private_key": "0x...",
    "rpc_url": "https://..."
  }
}
```

#### Automine Configuration

Arbius reference miner has an automine feature that will automatically generate new tasks. These tasks are available for anyone to solve, and you will be rewarded for solving them. You can enable automine by setting the `automine` flag to `true` in `MiningConfig.json`. If automine is disabled, your miner will only mine tasks that it notices on the network.

```json
{
  "automine": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

You will want to set the correct `model` and a unique `prompt` for tasks.


#### ML Configuration

Here is where you'll configure to connect to a running Cog container. Grab the prediction url from the api link of the Cog container you launched earlier. It will look something like: `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.notebooksd.jarvislabs.net/predictions`. **Make sure you do not share this url with anyone, as it can be used to access your Cog container.**

If your cog container is running on a separate server, you will need to make sure that the server allows incoming connections on the provided port.

```json
{
  "ml": {
    "strategy": "cog",
    "cog": {
      "0x82ae0d19f32b6912204160f8d744de08265b7775d07c23b4171c94c8e2892c62": {
        "url": "https://..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### IPFS Configuration

Here is where you'll configure to connect to a running IPFS node. If you are using pinata, you will need to use the pinata API url (see example cofig). You will want to use `http_client` strategy, to connect to your own IPFS, or `pinata` to connect to.. pinata.

```json
{
  "ipfs": {
    "strategy": "http_client",
    "http_client": {
      "url": "http://localhost:5001"
    }
  }
}
```

### Load Up Miner Wallet

You will need to load your miner wallet with some funds to pay for gas. You can do this by sending some funds to the address associated with your private key.

#### Arbitrum Nova

You can bridge funds from Ethereum to Arbitrum Nova using the Arbitrum bridge. You will need to use the Arbitrum bridge to send funds to your miner wallet.

https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=arbitrum-nova&sourceChain=ethereum

#### Arbius Token

Arbius(AIUS) token needs to be staked to mine. For the first day, no AIUS token is required to begin mining. After the first day, you will need to stake AIUS token to mine. You can obtain AIUS token from Uniswap. The miner will automatically stake AIUS token when it is required.

<Note>You will want to regularly bridge earned AIUS token back to Ethereum as it takes approximately 1 week to bridge. You also do not want to store too much AIUS in your miner wallet, as it is a security risk - if you are repeatedly slashed, you will lose the AIUS in your miner wallet.</Note>

## Test Mining Software 

Once your miner has sufficient funds and has been configured you can start it by running:

```bash
yarn start:dev MiningConfig.json
```

Your miner will perform a bootup sanity check by checking version as well as a test generation of the Kandinsky-2 model. If everything is good, it will start mining.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, please investigate the logs to determine the cause of the issue. If you are unable to resolve the issue, please reach out to the Arbius community for support.

If the miner seems stuck or is not mining, you can try restarting it. If this does not resolve the issue, try copying the db.sqlite file to a new location (for backup) and restarting the miner. This will allow the miner to start fresh.

## RPC Operation (advanced)

The miner provides a http api that allows the operator to control operation. This should never be exposed to the internet.

### Queue Jobs

To queue a job use the `api/jobs/queue` route.

```bash
curl "localhost:8335/api/jobs/queue" \
-X POST \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"method":"automine", "priority": 5, "waituntil": 0, "concurrent": false, "data": {}}'
```

A higher `priority` will increase the priority the job is run. `waituntil` defines the unix timestamp at which to run the task. `concurrent` sets whether or not this job will run concurrent with other jobs (usually it should be set to true, otherwise errors may occur).

#### Methods

##### pinTaskInput
* `taskid` [string]
* `input` [object]

##### task
* `taskid` [string]
* `txid` [string]

##### validatorStake
* `validatorMinimum` [string]

##### automine

##### solve
* `taskid` [string]

##### claim
