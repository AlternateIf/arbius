  'This guide gives you a quickstart into the Arbius Protocol.'

# Quickstart

The core to Arbius is a decentralized machine learning platform. Imagine Midjourney or ChatGPT, but on-chain, fully reproducible, and censorship resistant.

## Generate

To get started, let's generate a few things. Head over to [the generate](https://arbius.org/generate) page and try to make some images. You start by choosing a model, for this we'll use `Kandinsky 2`. Select it in the dropdown, then in the prompt textbox input whatever you imagine. Try something such as "a cat looking at the moon". For now, it should be possible to get tasks mined for free, but in the future you'd want to send some Arbius along with your request so that miners will prioritize your generation.

<Note>
  You will need an Ethereum compatible wallet. [Brave wallet](https://brave.com/) and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and both good options.

## Explore

Cool! Now let's see what some others have been making. Navigate to this [miners history page](https://arbius.org/history/0x1A320E53A25f518B893F286f3600cc204c181a8E) - all generations are public and visible by anyone. Try to find additional interesting artists who are creating cool stuff that is worth a follow or re-share.

## LP Staking

Want to start generating Arbius tokens yourself? By providing liquidity to the Arbius protocol you will get free Arbius made available to you - 10% of all newly created Arbius is sent to staked liquidity providers.

If you don't have any Arbius tokens yet, you can buy them on [SushiSwap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x158f9Ab4d4C6F36a7f6D7507223051cAc9d6284A&chainId=42170).

Pair these with Ethereum on Sushi's [Add Liquidity](https://app.sushi.com/legacy/add/ETH/0x158f9Ab4d4C6F36a7f6D7507223051cAc9d6284A?chainId=42170) page.

Finally, deposit your LP tokens on the [Staking](https://arbius.org/staking) page. You will start seeing your Arbius available to claim increasing. You can come back as much as you want to claim more, but there is not much benefit to claiming more than once a day.

Your claimed tokens now may be sold back to market, or used to pay for generations.

## Delegated mining

Another way to earn Arbius is to delegate your Arbius tokens to a miner. This is riskier than providing LP because the miner could lose tokens due to slashing, so be careful who you choose to trust. However, by delegating you will be entitled to a portion of the task rewards and fees that miner generates, which in total is where a lot of the newly created Arbius is going.

To delegate to another miner, navigate to the [Delegation](https://arbius.org/delegation) page and select the miner whom you wish to delegate to in the list. Since it is up to miners to enable/disable this functionality, its possible you will not see any who are interested in delegation currently.

You can then stake your Arbius tokens with them. You may do this with multiple different miners, maybe ones that specialize in different types of models, or just different ones for diversification purposes.

When the miner claims a task solution, a proportion of the reward will become available for you to claim.


## Become a miner (technical)

To become a miner you will need a powerful computer and substantial Arbius holdings. It is possible to "self-mine" which means generating new tasks for yourself to solve. You can earn large amounts of Arbius this way, however it requires substantial investment and technical knowledge.

## Register a model (technical)

Are you a machine learning researcher, someone who makes fine-tunes, or someone looking to monetize your open source work? Do you want to provide your models to the world in a way that makes them almost impossible to be shut down? Deploying your models to Arbius is simple and fun. And it's even possible to launch your model as a DAO, with a proven tokenomics model that allows anyone to invest in your work and share future rewards.

## Integrate Arbius (technical)

Do you have a dapp, marketplace, social media site, or some other idea that could benefit from decentralized machine learning?

## Governance

Participate in the future of Arbius! Arbius governance is completely decentralized and managed by the owners of the Arbius token. Delegate voting to yourself or someone else to participate in Arbius governance.
