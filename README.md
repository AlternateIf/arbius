Arbius is a decentralized network for machine learning and a token with limited inflation. New coins are generated with GPU power by participating in the network. There is no central authority to create new coins. Holders vote on-chain for protocol upgrades. Models operate as DAOS with custom rules for distribution and rewards, providing a way for model creators to earn income. Arbius runs on the [Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbitrum.io/) blockchain, and uses [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) for data storage.

## Project Layout

Arbius is a monorepo:

- **/contract** smart contracts and cli interface

- **/templates** model schema files used for mining and graphical interfaces

- **/website** frontend interface you see on arbius.org

- **/docs** frontend you see on docs.arbius.org

- **/paper** source for building pdf
